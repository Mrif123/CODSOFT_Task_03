# Iris Flower Classification
Developed a Iris Flower Classification model using Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine Algorithms to predict the species of the Iris Flowers which are Iris-Setosa,Iris-Virginica and Iris-Versicolor based on the features such as sepal length,sepal width,petal length,petal width.

To enhance the user experience designed a streamlit webapp for user to input the data through the input fields and predict the species of the iris flower based on the user input.

The snapshot of the Streamlit webapp is attached below:
